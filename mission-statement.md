#LearnProgramming Mentoring Community

The LearnProgramming Mentoring Community aims to be a group of projects and
individuals with the specific intent of teaching contributors how to contribute
to open source. By providing projects and tutorials with the express intent of
mentoring and teaching, we hope to provide a 'safe' place, free from outright
rejection and ridicule, where a new FOSS contributor can experiment, learn, and
-- ultimately -- contribute to real, usable FOSS projects.

Too often, FOSS projects -- due to factors primarily of time and grumpiness of the
maintainer -- tend to reject excited new contributors out of hand because their
code does not meet standards. It's not wrong that they do this, their intent is
to maintain a good application (an effort which should be lauded), not to teach
the new contributor how to write good code. To that effect, the LearnProgramming
Mentoring Community hopes to, in effect, provide a service -- teaching it's
members how to do things 'The Right Way'(tm) with everything from crafting a
good Pull Request to ensuring code is properly tested, documented, and --
crucially, well written.

To do this, the LearnProgramming Mentoring Community aims to provide high
quality tutorials, discussion arenas (including IRC, forums, etc); as well as
'hackable' projects for new contributors to work on. It's core promise is that
every pull request rejected is rejected with a clear reason, and where
appropriate, suggestions on how to make that request better.
